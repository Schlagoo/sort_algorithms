Repository containing following sorting algorithms implemented in Python3:

* InsertionSort
* SelectionSort
* BubbleSort
* MergeSort
* QuickSort


### Installing

Before running the script clone the repository to your desired directory:

~~~
cd /path/to/desired/directory
git clone git@github.com:Schlagoo/sort_algorithms
~~~

After uncommenting the desired function, you can run the script from the terminal (linux) via:

(Make shure you the file is executable: `sudo chmod +x ./algorithms.py`!)  

~~~
python3 ./algorithms.py
~~~

To choose a algorithm, just uncomment the desired method of the SortingAlgorithms-class at the bottom.
You can change the input depending on the algorithm.
